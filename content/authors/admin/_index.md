I am an undergraduate majoring in Electronic Information Science and Technology at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. My academic foundation spans MultiModal Large Language Models, Computer Vision, Embodied AI, 3D Vision, and Reinforcement Learning. Driven by curiosity and persistence, I aspire to develop intelligent algorithms that solve real-world problems and push the boundaries of artificial intelligence.

Currently looking for RA opportunities.
